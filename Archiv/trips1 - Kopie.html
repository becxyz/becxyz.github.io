    London. We started from Bonn main station on a sunny morning in June 2019. We took the train to Cologne where we changed to an ICE to Brussel. From Brussel we took the Eurostar to London St. Pancras International. Train ride was around 4 hours and some waiting time in between. It is much more comfortable than taking a plane. No need to check in your luggage or be at the airport hours before boarding. No waiting for the luggage after landing either. And the best advantage is that you are already in the heart of London, there is no need to take a tube or bus to get to the city.
    We stayed at a hotel close to London Paddington for 2 nights. We visited Camden Market and watched the musical Phantom of the Opera. As it was not the first time in London we skipped the tourism stuff.

    Oxford. From London we took the train to Oxford. In Oxford we stayed at a little Hotel ("The Richmond Hotel") close to the station for one night. We just took a walk through the lovely city and in the evening we visited a local pub. After the short stay in Oxford we headed to our next destination.

  Plymouth. On our way to Plymouth we had a great view through the train window. A really nice an green landscape. In Plymouth we walked to our accommodation uphill. We booked a really great room on AirBnB ("The Gallery Guasthouse"). We had a newly decorated room with a bathtube. Breakfast was early but the owner made it himself. So we got freshly made porridge and English Breakfast to start the day. We discovered the city for two days, had great food at local pubs and took little shop trip. Unfortunately the weather wasn't the greatest for June. :-) But we took some great shots. After two days our final destination was ready to be explored.

    Carbis Bay and St Ives. Finally. We took the train from Plymouth to St.Erth. From St. Erth it was only a few minutes to Carbis Bay. We had an indescribably view from the train while departing at Carbis Bay. It felt like we were arriving in the Caribbean. Everyone on the train (mostly English Familys vistiting Cornwall for a daytrip) where flashed and didn't believe they are still in the UK. We neither. Only this first view was worth the whole trip. In the following days I couldn't get enough from this gret landscape. Only a little train ride away without any flying around the whole world...
    We stayed at "Little House" up the hill. It was a great little house, also newly decorated and perfect for a short stay. But sadly we had only roof windows. so we couldn't enjoy the great views in the evening.
    But we had the whole day. So ne next couple of days we discovered Carbis Bay, took the costal path to St. Ives (which ist much more touristic) and headed to the other direction. The costal path is a path which you can walk all around Cornwall (1000km??). I don't want to write anymore but pictures tell you more than words.

      After leaving Carbis Bay we made a short stop at Penzances. Here we stayed at a small flat.
      Penzances is a cute little village. For our taste nothing special and it couldn't compete with Carbis Bay. But the walk to St. Michaels Mountain was a nice trip. It is a castle on an Island. you can walk there only some hours a day, after that you need to take boat. There is falling an rising tide (ebb and flow) so it is like the Northern Sea in Germany.
      From Penzances we took the train straight back to London where we stayed another night. you could do Cornwall to Germany on one day, but we had no rush. From London we gut back to Brussel and then to Cologne/Bonn.

Here you find the destinations from our trip. Everything work very well with train. We didn't took a car. England ist great with train, if you miss a train due to delay you get a refund after 15 minutes or you can easily catch the next train. There is no need to go to a counter and get there sign (like in Germany "Zugbindung aufheben"). So this is a very nice way to travel in the UK. The first struggle we had with trains was the ICE from Brussel to Cologne - so Deutsche Bahn.
If I would do this trip again we would only visit London and then go straight to Carbis Bay or another place with great view in Cornwall. Penzances and Plymouth were nice but nothing special for us.
If you need more information about the trip (train compansys - where to book - costs - time fpr traveling and so on) do not hesitate to contact me. All in all our trip was 11 nights/12 days.
